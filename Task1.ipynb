    "$\\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number - it cannot be rendered exactly as a fraction, or in decimal notation, no matter how many decimal places are specified [1].   \n",
    "One way of approximating the value is provided by Newton's Method. An iteration using the formula $$x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_n + \\frac{a}{x_n}) $$ approximates the $\\sqrt{a}$, with each subsequent value of $x_{n+1}$ being closer to the actual value than $x_n$. A simple explanation of how it works is that if $x_n$ is too large, then $a/x_n$ will be smaller than the square root, and the mean value of $x_n$ and $a/x_n$ will be closer to the root than $x_n$ is. Similarly if $x_n$ is too small, $a/x_n$ is greater than the root and the mean of the sum is again closer than $x_n$ [2].   \n",
